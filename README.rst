This repository is primarily here to help out with emailing long lists of ans
advisors.

Usage:

An example python script to be used for this process is provided in
example.py. First adapt it to be used for your email address and password and
test out the automation using the provided email template and test.csv
file. Once you're happy that it works for you, go ahead and export the NESD list
of ANS advisors from our Google Drive in CSV format. Note that it assumes your
advisor names have a prefix (Dr., Mr., Ms., etc.) and that last names are one
word if compounded (e.g. Dr. Mary Johnson-Smith rather than Dr. Mary Johnson
Smith). It should be ready to go once you replace that filename in the example
script!
