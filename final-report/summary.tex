The 2013 Nuclear Engineering Student Delegation (NESD) spent July 6-12 in
Washington, D.C. learning about the policy making process and advocating the
issues related to students in nuclear science and technology. The delegation
this year included sixteen students from twelve universities, and advocacy
focused on continued funding of the Integrated University Program and passage of
the Nuclear Waste Administration Act.

The first activity undertaken by the delegation was the drafting of a policy
statement, advocating for our constituency, to be delivered to policymakers and
their staffs later in the week. The delegation then met with a number of players
in the policy-making realm, including AREVA and the Nuclear Energy Institute
(NEI), representatives of the nuclear industry; the Department of Energy (DOE),
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and Office of Management and Budget (OMB),
representatives of the executive branch; and legislative members and their
staff. The delegation was fortunate this year to meet four out of the five
commissioners of the NRC as well as Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy,
Dr. Peter Lyons.

The 2013 NESD was successful in its twin purposes -- to educate and inspire a
group of talented, young nuclear engineers about the policy-making world of
Washington, D.C., and to convey the thoughts, opinions, and interests of nuclear
engineering students to policymakers. The delegates expressed their keen
appreciation for such an opportunity, and the delegation is extremely grateful
for the support received from NEI, ANS, and their respective universities.
