\section{Executive Summary}

The Nuclear Engineering Student Delegation marked another successful trip in
July 2013.  Delegates had unforgettable experiences learning about, and
participating in the policymaking process.

A focus of the 2013 delegation was to meet with Senate offices to encourage
support for the Integrated University Program.  At the time of the Delegation,
the House Energy and Water appropriations bill had passed, with funding for IUP
included.  The Senate bill, which did not include IUP funding, had left
committee but not yet reached the floor for a vote.

Each NESD is a new and unique delegation. For the first time, the 2013
Delegation had meetings the Department of State and four NRC Commissioners,
including Chairman Macfarlane.  In addition, in keeping with at least the past
two delegations, the 2013 NESD met with NEI senior staff, executive branch
officials from DOE (including Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Pete
Lyons), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), NRC, Annie Caputo- a Professional
Staff member at House Energy and Commerce Committee and the United States House
of Representatives, and the current ANS fellow Vincint Esposito.  The main
efforts of the Delegates were spent meeting with Members of Congress and their
staffers; the NESD was successful in meeting with or submitting policy
statements to every Senate office and a sizable number of House offices.

The 2013 NESD was successful in its twin purposes – to educate and inspire a
group of talented, young nuclear engineers about the policy-making world of
Washington, DC; and to convey the thoughts, opinions, and interests of nuclear
engineering students to policymakers.  It was an experience none of the
delegates will soon forget, and we are extremely grateful for the support we
received from NEI, ANS, and everyone who took time to meet with us.

\section{Feedback for Next Year}

Most of the feedback from the delegates regarding the 2013 NESD was positive.  A
sampling of positive statements from the final Delegation meeting is included
here:

\begin{itemize}
\item The organization of this years Delegation received high praise
\item Preparation for key meetings, such as OMB, was much improved over the
  previous years Delegation
\item Delegates all thought that the meetings set up for the Delegation were
  outstanding and invaluable
\end{itemize}

Some ideas that were suggested for consideration are listed here:
\begin{itemize}
\item Delegates should be encouraged to contact their university Washington
  liaisons for advice and potential coordination with existing efforts.
\item Attempts should be made to set up meetings with Appropriations Committee
  staff.  Several delegates enthusiastically endorsed this idea.
\item An intro/preparatory meeting with a budget expert would be useful,
  especially for delegates not already familiar with the intricacies of the
  federal budget process.
\item An idea of having the Delegation extend from mid-week to mid-week rather
  than beginning on a weekend was raised.  This would allow for some of the
  preparatory meetings to occur before the statement-writing session.  Some
  delegates felt that information received at meetings could have been
  fruitfully incorporated into the statement-writing process.
\item For next years Delegation, formal thank you and follow-up letters could be
  sent to key people with whom the delegation meets.
\end{itemize}

Other suggestions focused on preparing future delegates, such as additions and
improvements to the Guidebook prepared this year.  The Guidebook was well
received, and the delegates found it useful.

All in all, the feedback from the delegates was that the 2013 Nuclear
Engineering Student Delegation was a success.  The delegates’ suggestions for
improvement focused on ways that next years delegation can be made even more
effective.  All delegates left the week with greatly increased understanding of
the importance of being involved in the legislative process, as well as renewed
passion for doing whatever they can to help support nuclear education programs.

\section{Conclusion}

The 2013 Nuclear Engineering Student Delegation was very successful in educating
policymakers on the needs for supporting nuclear engineering education and the
members of the delegation on the political process. During the delegations time
in Washington, D.C., members were able to speak for nuclear science and
engineering students throughout the country and show their enthusiasm for
nuclear professions. This years delegation was fortunate to meet with some very
influential members and advocates of the nuclear community. The NESD was also
very successful on Capitol Hill as they were able to visit or meet with the
offices of numerous members of the House of Representatives and most sitting
members of the Senate during their time in Washington, D.C.

The primary goal of this year’s delegation was to express to policymakers the
need for the Integrated University Program (IUP) that provides fellowships and
scholarships through DOE/NE and NRC to nuclear science and engineering
students. Currently, the IUP has been funded under the House's Water \& Energy
Appropriations bill. It is still uncertain whether or not the senate will
include the IUP in their appropriations bill.p

All members of the 2013 NESD were very pleased with their experience in
Washington, D.C. Delegates who will be in school next year look forward to the
possibility of being part of the 2014 NESD, which will be chaired by Nicholas
Thompson (Rensselar Polytechnic Institute). Finally, the members of the
delegation would like to thank the Nuclear Energy Institute, American Nuclear
Society, and all of the universities of the delegates for their help and
support.
