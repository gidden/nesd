\footnotetext{This amount is larger than normal because no delegates required
  travel or accomodation assitance, and we had a cheaper-than-normal dinner at
  L'Enfant Plaza due to time restrictions. We are looking into the possibility
  of assisting the hosting of a social event at an ANS meeting to increase our
  visibility and future application pool.}
