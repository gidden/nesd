Hi Dr. so-and-so,

My name is my-name, and I’m the-a-position of this year’s Nuclear Engineering Student Delegation. We’re an organization that advocates for funding for nuclear science and technology students and their respective universities. Every year, we bring approximately 15 students from around the nation together in Washington, D. C. to talk with policymakers within the executive branch, draft a policy statement, and visit the Hill to  express our views to our respective congresspeople. The Delegation occurs over ~5 days in July, meeting with officials at the DOE, NRC, OMB, and the NEI, among others.

We’d like to ask for your assistance in distributing a notice of this opportunity. Students apply for the opportunity at our website, and we choose the final applicants via an interview process after an initial review. This is a great opportunity for students at your university to get hands-on experience in the policy realm in addition to advocating for nuclear university program and student funding. We pride ourselves in providing a critical student perspective to policy makers, especially in an less-than-stable funding environment. Feel free to contact us at nesd@nesd.org if you have any further questions.

Warm regards,

my-name
the-a-position, NESD 2013
